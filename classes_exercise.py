1. Create a class according to the following requirements:
It's name is Vehicle and it has the following attributes/methods:
Attributes/properties:
  name: str
  max_speed: int
  capacity: int
Methods:
    vroom() -> None
        Prints "Vroom" max_speed times - if max_speed 60, say vroom 60 times wow
2. Create a child/subclass of Vehicle called Bus with the following methods:
Methods:
    fare(age: float) -> None
        Prints "The fare of the bus ride is {}."
